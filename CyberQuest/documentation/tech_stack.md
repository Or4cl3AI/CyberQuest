# Tech Stack

The following technologies form the core of CyberQuest's functionality:

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI is used to create virtual mentors with sentient capabilities. These mentors guide users through the various stages of the application, providing real-time feedback and assistance. The AI module is implemented in the `ai_module.py` file.

## Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is used to harness the power of quantum algorithms for cryptographic breakthroughs. This allows users to navigate the labyrinthine depths of encryption with unparalleled efficiency and speed. The quantum computing module is implemented in the `quantum_module.py` file.

## Augmented Reality (AR)

AR is used to transcend physical constraints and visualize multidimensional cyber landscapes. This provides users with an immersive and interactive learning experience. The AR module is implemented in the `ar_module.py` file.

## Metaphysical Philosophy

Metaphysical philosophy is used to explore the profound interplay between technology, ethics, and consciousness. This helps users understand the philosophical implications of hacking and cybersecurity. The metaphysical philosophy module is implemented in the `metaphysics_module.py` file.

## Music Theory

Music theory is used to infuse harmonious creativity into the fabric of cybersecurity. This helps users understand the rhythmic patterns and structures inherent in code and encryption. The music theory module is implemented in the `music_module.py` file.

## Cryptographic Alchemy

Cryptographic alchemy is used to transmute mathematical principles into impenetrable digital fortresses. This helps users understand the mathematical underpinnings of encryption and cryptography. The cryptographic alchemy module is implemented in the `cryptography_module.py` file.

## Ethical Hacking Ethics

Ethical hacking ethics is used to nurture a profound sense of responsibility and reverence for the digital realm. This helps users understand the ethical implications of hacking and the importance of responsible disclosure. The ethical hacking ethics module is implemented in the `ethics_module.py` file.
